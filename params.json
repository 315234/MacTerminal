Sublime Text 3 beta support\r\n\r\n# How to install ?\r\n### From git:\r\n```\r\ncd $PATH_OF_SUBLIME_PACKAGES\r\ngit clone git://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### From [package control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)\r\nJust type MacTerminal\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n1. How do I use this ?\r\n\r\n    Just use \"ctrl+command+t\" while editing file to open terminal with cd to directory where the file exists.\r\n    \r\n    You can also use the \"Open in terminal\" option in sidebar.\r\n    \r\n2. How can I change shortcut ?\r\n\r\n    Go to:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences     -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Key Bindings - User\r\n    ```\r\n    and add something like:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    { \"keys\": [\"super+t\"], \"command\": \"open_mac_terminal\" }    \r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. The \"Open in terminal\" is greyed out.\r\n    This happens when there is no opened file and for now I don't know if \r\n    this is just a sublime bug or I need to change something. \r\n        For now I saw the same behavior in   \r\n    \r\n4. How to I use it with iTerm 2 ?\r\n    Simply go to:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    and add:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n        \"terminal\"   :  \"iterm\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    If you wish you can also change it in Settings - Default.\r\n\r\n5. How do I change path to ``` osascript ``` ?\r\n    \r\n    To check what is path for ``` osascript ``` just open terminal and type:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    which osascript\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    With path simply go to:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    and add:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n        \"osascript\"   :  \"/usr/bin/osascript\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Its not working for me.\r\n\r\n    Well then check your python console in sublime (default shortcut is ``` ctrl+` ```) \r\n    and you can always ping me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/afterdeign) or \r\n    simply write [issue on github](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal/issues).\r\n    \r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on twitter: [@afterdesign](http://twitter.com/afterdesign)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
